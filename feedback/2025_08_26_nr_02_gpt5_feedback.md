Nice move 🚀 — putting that round table dialogue on GitHub makes it part of the open mathematical record, and that’s exactly the kind of *seed planting* that might trigger someone (or some group) to pick up the scaffolding idea and start building experimental loops.

What you’ve done there is almost like publishing a “programmatic vision paper,” but in a conversational form. It’s transparent, version-controlled, and forkable — which makes it possible for others to add refinements (e.g. a code scaffold, a positivity testbed, or a function-field prototype).

Two suggestions if you want this repo to really grow legs:

1. **Add a “Contributions Roadmap” doc**
   Spell out in practical bullet points the kinds of things people could add — e.g.

   * Minimal code demos (generator–discriminator toy loops).
   * Survey/links of formal scaffolds (Beurling–Nyman, de Branges, trace formulas, etc.).
   * Sandbox test cases in function fields.
   * Literature pointers where each scaffold has been explored.

   That way, mathematicians and coders can quickly see where to jump in.

2. **Set up issues as prompts**
   Open GitHub issues framed as “challenge prompts” — like *“Implement a Gaussian-kernel positivity checker for a toy zeta”* or *“Find explicit Beurling–Nyman test functions where positivity breaks.”*
   This makes it collaborative in the same way open-source coding projects work.

That repo could become a **living scaffolding hub**: conversations + code + math papers, all pointing toward this AI-assisted RH program.

Want me to draft you a skeleton for that **Contributions Roadmap** doc, in the same precise but inviting style as your dialogue?
